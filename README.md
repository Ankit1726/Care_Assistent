### ***🌟 About Care Health System***

***Care Health System is a medical education assistant built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It answers health questions from a curated medical knowledge base, supplements them with web research when needed, and always cites the sources it used while explaining how certain (or uncertain) the answer is.***

***Users can type a question, upload an image, take a photo with the camera, or speak using the microphone, and then have the answer read aloud.***

| Step | Stage | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Understand query** | Process text, image or transcribed voice input |
| 2 | **Retrieve from KB** | Fetch the most relevant chunks from medical documents |
| 3 | **Check evidence** | Decide whether the retrieved context answers the question |
| 4 | **Web research** | Search the web when the knowledge base is not enough |
| 5 | **Cited answer** | Generate the response from gathered evidence, with sources and uncertainty |

### ***🧪 Why Cited, Uncertainty-Aware Answers Matter***

Health information is high-stakes, so the assistant is designed to be transparent:

```text
Knowledge Base Evidence Found?
          ↓
Evidence Good Enough?
          ↓
   YES → Answer from the knowledge base
   NO  → Research the web
          ↓
Cite sources + state what is uncertain
```

---

### ***⚠️ Limitations***

- Answer quality depends on the quality and coverage of the ingested documents.
- Web research results depend on external search availability and source quality.
- Image understanding is limited and is not a diagnosis.
- Free-tier hosting may have cold starts and non-persistent disk storage.
- LLM, search and vector services require network access and valid API keys.

---

### ***🔮 Future Enhancements***

- Multi-language support
- User accounts and saved chat history
- Evaluation suite for retrieval and answer quality
- Improved medical-image analysis
- Admin dashboard for document management
- Mobile-friendly PWA
